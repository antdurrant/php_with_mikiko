<?php
	{php code goes here}
?>php echo()
is like print() or similar

- php needs semi-colons at the end of every line
- php doesn't need parentheses
- php can take php in its arguments
  - e.g. echo("<h1> HI </h1>")
- php goes in order of lines written
- use single or double quotes, but stay consistent
	- can use single quotes for css inside the double quotes for php
